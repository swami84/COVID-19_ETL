Goal: This git aids in getting the latest county-wise confirmed COVID-19 cases and generates a csv file 
after merging with county information (population, land area)

Instructions:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/swami84/COVID-19_ETL.git
$ cd COVID-19_ETL
$ sh install.sh
```

This will install the python environment and run the ETL and store the csv in Output folder
